Player P
Machines A,B,C,D

======================================================================
machine locations (external)
======================================================================
A (01): 00, 00, 00 @ overworld
B (02): 26, 40, 26 @ compact_world (inside A)
C (03): 51, 40, 51 @ compact_world (inside B)
D (04): 10, 10, 10 @ overworld
A (05): 76, 40, 76 @ compact_world (inside D)
A (06): 51, 40, 51 @ compact_world (inside C)

======================================================================
Tree View of machine nesting
======================================================================
A from 01 (entangled - at 0,0,0 in overworld)
    B from 02 (entered at 01, 40, 01)
        C from 03 (entered at 26, 40, 26)
            A from 06 (entangled - entered at 51, 40, 51)

D from 04 (non-entangled, at 10, 10, 10 in overworld)
    A from 05 (entangled, at 76, 40, 76 in compact_world)

======================================================================
Facts
======================================================================
B is not entangled and inside A.
C is not entangled and inside B.
A is entangled, and inside C and D.
======================================================================

- P enters A from {0,0,0} (entry-1)
- P enters B from A.
- P enters C from B.
- P reenters A from C.

======================================================================
Deque status at end of entering A (06) - player_entry_history
======================================================================
tail    DimPos { 51, 40, 51   @ compact_world }     (entered A from C)
-       DimPos { 26, 40, 26   @ compact_world }     (entered C from B)
-       DimPos { 01, 40, 01   @ compact_world }     (entered B from A)
head    DimPos { 00, 00, 00   @ overworld }         (entered A)

Player P is represented as "inside" A, B, and C.
Re-entering machine A does not add a second entry to the list.

======================================================================
Deque status at end of entering A (05) - player_entry_history
======================================================================
tail    DimPos { 79, 40, 76   @ compact_world }     (entered A from D)
head    DimPos { 10, 00, 10   @ overworld }         (entered D)

Player P is represented as "inside" A, B, C, and D.
    B and C are included because A is inside C, and the tree was traversed upwards.
